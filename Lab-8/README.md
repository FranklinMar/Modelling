# Laboratory work #8

## About

This folder is dedicated to Lab-8.

## Tasks:
_Lab8_ - Find the optimal value of the parameter **_x_**, which leads to
minimum objective function:

$$ f(x) = d_1 ⋅ x^3 + d_2 ⋅ x^2 + d_3 ⋅ x + d_4 → min $$

on the interval x ∈ [0;10] with an accuracy of δ = 0.01. Apply the method
of interval division in half. Plot the objective function to display the 
local minimum.

### Programming Task:
Create a function optimization program to solve the problem above.
A program must have a function as a parameter and find its local minimum,
and display it with a plot of the function.
