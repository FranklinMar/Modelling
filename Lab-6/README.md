# Laboratory work #6

## About

This folder is dedicated to Lab-6.

## Tasks:
_Lab6_ - Solve problems, where a mathematical model must be described as
Mass Service System (MSS) and formulas of performance indicators.

### Programming Task:
Write a universal calculator program (with the choice of MSS type), which will
calculate performance indicators for each type of Mass Service System:

- single-channel MSS with rejections;
- multi-channel MSS with rejections;
- single-channel MSS with limited queue waiting.

After opening your ready-made calculator, you will only need to enter
the main indicators of the corresponding MSS, and its performance indicators
will calculate by itself.
