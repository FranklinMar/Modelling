This folder is dedicated to Lab-3.

## Tasks:
_Lab3_ - Find the solution function to Cauchy's problem task for a regular first-order differential equation
_y'_ = _f(x,y)_ on an interval _[a, b]_ with step _h_=_0.1_ with initial conditions _y(x<sub><sup>0</sub></sup>)_=_y<sub><sup>0</sub></sup>_.
Find values to 3 decimal places (precision 0.001).
Find the solution:

  1) with numerical methods:
    1. using Euler's method;
    2. using Euler-Cauchy's method;
    3. using improved Euler's method;
    4. using Runge-Kutt's 4-th order method;
  2) with precise differential equation solution, calculated with one of the Math packages or online-solver;
  3) and build a plot for each method, as well as precise solution;
  4) compare calculated approximate values of numerical methods with precise solution with graphs.
